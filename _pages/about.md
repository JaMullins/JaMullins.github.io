Experienced computer scientist and game developer. Known languages include Java, Python, SQL, Lua, and JavaScript.
Previous projects include a particle-based visual simulation library created in PyGame, capable of simulating fire, wind,
and gravitational fields. Previous games developed used the Lua-based engine Roblox Studio. These games acted as a

a developers standpoint
